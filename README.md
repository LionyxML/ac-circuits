# AC Circuits

It's a .org file you can use within emacs to solve basic monophasic AC circuits

Requires: emacs + org-mode + calc (all built-in on modern emacs)

Tested under Linux, Windows 10 and MacOS Catalina.

## Features
Allows you to solve for impedance, current and voltage, both on rectangular and polar forms on the following classic circuits:
- Pure Resistive
- Pure Inductive 
- Pure Capacitive
- RL Series
- RC Series
- RLC Series
- RL Parallel
- RC Parallel
- RLC Parallel
